## SSH

### ssh-copy-id on Windows

`cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh [USERNAME]@[IP/HOST] "cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

If `~/.ssh` or `authorized_keys` doesn't exist, you have to create the `.ssh` directory and the `authorized_keys` file the first time.

 1. Create the `.ssh` directory & set the right permissions (if needed):

        mkdir ~/.ssh
        chmod 700 ~/.ssh
 3. Create the `authorized_keys` file:

        touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
 4. Set the right permissions:

        chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
